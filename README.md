# terraform-lab-file-structure
This repoistory shows your expected file structure through out the progression of your labs this will allow you to git clone the environment if you want the structure quickly.

Please keep in mind the way I have shown the file structure is your expected file structure to your repoistory/code folder to expand on you are not expected to copy all the code into a new folder after you have completed your first lab its just building onto your current code this is just to show example of the files and structure expected that each exercise/lab will have by the end of the tasks.
